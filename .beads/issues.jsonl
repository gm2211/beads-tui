Main list view: DataTable with all issues, color-coded by priority \u0026 status\n2. Detail panel: full issue details in side panel or overlay screen\n3. Inline editing: change priority (p), status (s), assignee (a), title (e)\n4. Create form: modal form to create new issues (c)\n5. Search/filter: text search + filter by status/priority/type\n6. Comments: view and add comments on issues\n7. Labels: view and manage labels\n8. Close/reopen issues\n9. Live reload: periodic polling with diff-based updates (no flicker)\n10.
